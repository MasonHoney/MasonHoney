                <h3>Where it All Began</h3>
                <p>Long ago in a land far away I was born to an old Southern family. My mother taught me to be ever curious and my father taught me the value of integrity and hard work. With these family virtues I followed in my father's footsteps to become a mechanic. I studied Aivation Maintenance Technologies and obtained my A&P certificate from the FAA. Though he is a diesel mechanic, Dear Ol' Dad helped me in my studies and I found gainful employment maintaining aircraft.</p>
                <p>While aviation is a highly advanced industry, my training did not involve extensive use of computers. The only formal instruction I received on computer usage was during my obligatory "MS Office" classes to fulfill concurrent college credit requirements during high school. Professionally, I was only required to use computers to access technical documentation for the aircraft I was maintaining. Needless to say, the little tech skill I had obtained playing video games as a child was severely outdated.</p>
                <h3>The Tech Journey Begins</h3>
                I have had a pretty varried career up until present.
