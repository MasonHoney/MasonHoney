                <h3>Where it All Began</h3>
                <p>Long ago in a land far away I was born to an old Southern family. My mother taught me to be ever curious and my father taught me the value of integrity and hard work. With these family virtues I followed in my father's footsteps to become a mechanic. I studied Aivation Maintenance Technologies and obtained my A&P certificate from the FAA. Though he is a diesel mechanic, Dear Ol' Dad helped me in my studies and I found gainful employment maintaining aircraft.</p>
                <p>While aviation is a highly advanced industry, my training did not involve extensive use of computers. The only formal instruction I received on computer usage was during my obligatory "MS Office" classes to fulfill concurrent college credit requirements during high school. Professionally, I was only required to use computers to access technical documentation for the aircraft I was maintaining. Needless to say, the little tech skill I had obtained playing video games as a child was severely outdated.</p>
                <h3>Paved with Good Intentions</h3>
                <p>I have had a pretty varied career up until present,from helping Dad at his shop to fixing construction equipment and performing maintenance on crop-dusters and passenger aircraft. I've put a wrench to just about everything However, with all those jobs I couldn't help but notice that things seemed one dimensional.</p>
                <p>It was as though no matter how much experience I gained in my career as a technician I would never do anything but pull wrenches. For most mechanics that's the goal. Most people don't want to leave their toolbox, But for me this felt stifling. Stagnant. Stale.</p>
                <p>Once I landed at my current place of employment and found myself struggling with the lax nature of the non-avitation world I decided I had had enough. Something had to change. Mama didn't raise no fool though. I knew I needed a plan. So, I began to consider a career change. But to what?! Perhaps I should take after my grandfathers and strike out on an entrepreneurial venture?</p>
                <h3>The Tech Journey Begins</h3>
                <p>Hoping for a better life with more fulfillment and career satisfaction, my wife and I mulled over several business ideas. Farming? Nah. Cosmetics? Ha! Maybe for her. How about beekeeping? Sounds fun, but unpredictable. We pondered and toyed with ideas for a while but ultimately the hope started to fade. Maybe we can look into this again when we pay off some bills.</p>
                <p>In the meantime I kept on working and listening to podcasts while doing so as one does. One day an episode came across talking about "digital privacy". This piqued my interest as I had always assumed there was little more one could do to secure their data beyond paying for expensive antivirus software and using best internet practices. I was mistaken, sorely mistaken.</p>
                <p>Over the course of the episode I learned there was such a thing as Linux and open source software with whole communities selflessly laboring to provide not only quality but also security for the general digital public. This lit a fire under me. I had a new obsession. And, as if by divine providence, I had a family member who had a very similar idea.</p>
                <p>In the background to my personal struggles my brother-in-law was deciding he wanted to go into the video game development field. At first I was skeptical of his ambitions. Tech is a very competitive industry after all. However, after my epiphany with the podcast I realize he might be onto something after all.</p>
                <p>I'm not much of a gamer myself, though my younger brother is looking to change that with our weekly online gaming sessions. No, I don't think I'll be throwing my hat into that particular ring any time soon. I think I'm more drawn to the side of programming that enhances everyday life. I know that seems broad and maybe it is. I am still very new to all of this. I'm like a pup who's eyes have opened for the first time.</p>
                <p>I am fascinated with FOSS and open source hardware. Being a mechanic I feel a certain familiarity with the hardware aspect of tech. I want to build it all. My own computer. Heck my own network! I want to build the software that makes it run. I want to have a hand in all of it! I know I need to curb my enthusiasm, and that will come with time, but right now I am on fire for this new adventure.</p>
                <h3>Accepting the Past and Embracing the Future</h3>
                <p>Oh how much time I wasted! Here I am in my early 30's timidly treading where others ran in their teens. Such is life though, and my experiences are what make me the man I am today. Should I have studied computer science in college? Maybe. Will it take me a while to learn things on my own? Almost certainly. Despite this, I believe the teams I will be apart of in the future will be all the stronger for the perspective my old life brings and the tenacity that comes with being a self-taught dev.</p>
                <p>A brave new world lies before me and I am ready to embrace it!</p>
