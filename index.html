<h1>James Mason Honey</h1>
  <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>My name is James Honey, but my friends call me Mason, <em>long</em> story.</p>
    <p>I am a self-taught developer trying to break out of the maintenance industry and into Tech. If you'd like to see some of the things I've been working on feel free to click the "Portfolio" link below. If that <em>long</em> story I mentioned earlier sounds interesting click the "About Me" link.</p>

  
  <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
